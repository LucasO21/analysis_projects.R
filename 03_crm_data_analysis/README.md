CRM DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT
---

## Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis of CRM data from a company selling computer hardware. The primary focus was on establishing performance benchmarks, understanding sales trends, and segmenting customers to enhance sales and marketing strategies.

## Objectives
Analyze Key Metrics: Deal Close Rate, Average Deal Value, and Average Deal Event Value.
Segmentation: Evaluate data across various segments, including sector, employee size, and regional office.
Trend Analysis: Identify patterns over time to understand the effectiveness of sales strategies.

## Methodology
Metrics were calculated for individual sales representatives and segmented based on:

* Sectors: Technology, Medical, Marketing, etc.
* Employee Size: Ranging from small (0-1000 employees) to large (10,000+ employees).
* Regional Offices: East, Central, West.

Quantiles were used to categorize sales reps into top, mid, and low performers based on a combined score of the metrics. Trends over time were also analyzed, with the last two months excluded from trend data due to incomplete deal closures.

## Limitations
* Data Completeness: Exclusion of the latest data might omit recent trends and performances.
* Lack of Context: Absence of detailed business strategy and market conditions may limit the depth of analysis.
